KPI Notes: Write SMART KPIs - specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bound. Defining KPIs is the first step when starting a BI project.
Metrics are another measure to track the performance of specific business processes and help provide context to the performance of key business goals, but are not critical to its success like KPIs.

Descriptive Analytics:
  - descriptive analytics uses historical and current data to spot any trends and relationships between that data.
  - it draws insights entirely from past data considering what happened, and can be treated as an initial phase of data processing.
  - it is not possible to generalize the findings to a bigger population and it doesn't tell you anything about the data collection method used.

Diagnostic Analytics:
  - helps identify the reason an event occurred. It lets you discover hidden correlations and connections between variables, determine causal relationships, detect anomalies, and isolate patterns. 
  - uses past data to provide answers to queries.
  - It uses many techniques such as probability theory, time-series analysis, filtering, and regression analysis.

Predictive Analytics:
  - predicts future outcomes
  - relies on historical data and uses statistical models, data mining and ML for predicitions
  - advantages - it eliminates the need for manual research, analyzes masive data sets and continuously refines models.
  - disadvantages - requires significant effor and time

Prescriptive Analytics:
  - Recommends the optimal course of action to achieve a specific goal. It is used to make complex decisions, forecasting and automate the decision making process to be more data driven.

In summary Descriptive analytics summarizes raw data to reveal trends. Diagnostic analytics correlates the data with other data sets to find the reason for the trends.
Predictive analytics uses historical data to predict trends. Prescriptive data goes beyond descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analytics to recommend the next course of action based on various data points.


BI Component and Tools Notes:
  - Before starting a BI Project its important to list requirements, data sources, data governance, methods, and tools. You would also list the ETL process, data models, types of reports, analytical capabilities, training, and budget requirements for the BI project.

Gathering Data:
  - The process begins by identifiying the information that needs to be collected which is determined by the goal. next step is to identidy the source which can be internal or external and they can be primary, sechondary or third-party.

Wrangling Data:
  - Process splits into four categories:
      1. Discovery: Understanding your data for your use case and create a plan for cleaning, structuring, organizing and mapping your data.
      2. Transformation: Structuring Data, Cleaning/Enriching Data
      3. Validation: check the quality of data after structuring, normalizing, denormalizing, cleaning and enriching of data
      4. Publising: Deliver the output of the weangled data for downstream project needs.

  - It is important to document the steps you took, and add personal considerations for taking those steps, to convert raw data into analysis-ready data.
