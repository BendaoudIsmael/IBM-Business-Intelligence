Descriptive Analytics:
  - descriptive analytics uses historical and current data to spot any trends and relationships between that data.
  - it draws insights entirely from past data considering what happened, and can be treated as an initial phase of data processing.
  - it is not possible to generalize the findings to a bigger population and it doesn't tell you anything about the data collection method used.

Diagnostic Analytics:
  - helps identify the reason an event occurred. It lets you discover hidden correlations and connections between variables, determine causal relationships, detect anomalies, and isolate patterns. 
  - uses past data to provide answers to queries.
  - It uses many techniques such as probability theory, time-series analysis, filtering, and regression analysis.
