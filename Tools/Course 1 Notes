KPI Notes: Write SMART KPIs - specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bound. Defining KPIs is the first step when starting a BI project.
Metrics are another measure to track the performance of specific business processes and help provide context to the performance of key business goals, but are not critical to its success like KPIs.

Descriptive Analytics:
  - descriptive analytics uses historical and current data to spot any trends and relationships between that data.
  - it draws insights entirely from past data considering what happened, and can be treated as an initial phase of data processing.
  - it is not possible to generalize the findings to a bigger population and it doesn't tell you anything about the data collection method used.

Diagnostic Analytics:
  - helps identify the reason an event occurred. It lets you discover hidden correlations and connections between variables, determine causal relationships, detect anomalies, and isolate patterns. 
  - uses past data to provide answers to queries.
  - It uses many techniques such as probability theory, time-series analysis, filtering, and regression analysis.

Predictive Analytics:
  - predicts future outcomes
  - relies on hitoral data and uses statistical models, data mining and ML for predicitions
  - advantages - it eliminates the need for manual research, analyzes masive data sets and continuously refines models.
  - disadvantages - requires significant effor and time

Prescriptive Analytics:
  - Recommends the optimal course of action to achieve a specific goal. It is used to make complex decisions, forecasting and automate the decision making process to be more data driven.

In summary Descriptive analytics summarizes raw data to reveal trends. Diagnostic analytics correlates the data with other data sets to find the reason for the trends.
Predictive analytics uses historical data to predict trends. Prescriptive data goes beyond descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analytics to recommend the next course of action based on various data points.
